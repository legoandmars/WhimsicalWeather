# Whimsical Weather
Adds a new pyrovision-inspired weather type to Lethal Company.

Made solo over the course of a week for the [2023 Lethal Company Modjam](https://itch.io/jam/2023-lethal-company-modjam).

## Features
When in "Whimsical Vision", this mod has many visual changes, many of which have config options:
- Custom postprocessing shader
- Rainbow UI and text (with configurable speed)
- Disabled blood/gore
- Changes to the following items: Walkie Talkie, 7Ball, ZapGun, Magnifying Glass, Apparatus, Shovel, Stop Sign, Yield Sign

- Changes to the following enemies: Eyeless Dogs, Jester, Hygrodere
- Rainbow item dropship lights
- Pitched up voice chat (with configurable pitch)

All changes are completely reversible, and will exclusively effect your game when in Whimsical Vision.
